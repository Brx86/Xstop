# Xstop
**English**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**简体中文**](https://github.com/Brx86/Xstop/blob/main/README_zh.md)

Pause/resume x11 windows with just one click to reduce CPU usage and heat. Inspired by [xkill](https://man.archlinux.org/man/xkill.1) and [xsuspender](https://github.com/kernc/xsuspender).

## Usage:
Install from AUR：
```bash
paru -S xstop
```
Add a keyboard shortcut in the system settings, the command is `xstop`.

Press the shortcut key, the cursor will become a cross, then click any x11 window with the left mouse button to suspend the process and sub-process of the window. Press the shortcut key and click again to resume. 

The window is unresponsive during the pause, the display may be abnormal, and the operation will be blocked until resumed.
